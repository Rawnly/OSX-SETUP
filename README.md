## MISC
### Font
The font used in the screenshot is [Fira Code][firacode]

### Terminal APP
My main terminal is currently [iTerm2][iterm]. I moved from [hyper][hyperjs] because [iTerm][iterm] is faster.

#### iTerm2
You can find my [configuration file](terminal-config/iTerm2/config.json) and [colorscheme](terminal-config/iTerm2/rawnly.itermcolors) in [`terminal-config/iTerm2`](terminal-config/iTerm2/)

#### Hyper JS
You can fund my [`.hyper.js`](terminal-config/Hyper/hyper.js) in [`terminal-config/Hyper`](terminal-config/Hyper)

> Many people asked me a few times my hyper config in the past. Sincerely I don't remember it, it's past quite a few time since i moved to iTerm and I've lost my custom configuration (no theme...), however I strongly recommend these 2 plugins (*this is also my current configuration*): 
- [verminal theme][verminal]
  - if you want to make verminal look more minimal, see [#19](https://github.com/defringe/verminal/issues/19) or just look at [my config](terminal-config/Hyper/hyper.js)

- [hyper-spotify][hyperspotify].
