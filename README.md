## MISC
### Font
The font used in the screenshot is [Fira Code][firacode]

### Terminal APP
My main terminal is currently [iTerm2][iterm]. I moved from [hyper][hyperjs] because [iTerm][iterm] is faster.

### Hyper JS Suggestions
Many people asked me my hyper config in the past, so, sincerely I don't remember, it's past quite a few time and it was a custom configuration (no theme), however I strongly recommend these 2 plugins: 

- [verminal theme][verminal]
  - if you want to make verminal look more minimal, see [#19](https://github.com/defringe/verminal/issues/19)
- [hyper-spotify][hyperspotify].
